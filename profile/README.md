# Chapter 39

🚀 **Chapter 39** is a set of templates and utilities to accelerate app development.
The goal is to keep a common, modular foundation so we don't reinvent the wheel on every project.

## 🔹 Main repositories

- **shared-template** → Shared styles and utilities (SCSS, types, etc.)
- **minimal-template** → Minimal JavaScript base to get started quickly.
- **landing-template** → Static landing template (ready for GitHub Pages).
- **design-template** → UI components and design system.
- **app-template** → Template for full frontend applications.
- **backend-template** → Template for Node.js backends.
- **docs** → Internal documentation and notes.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce friction when starting new projects.
- Unify styles, types, and best practices.
